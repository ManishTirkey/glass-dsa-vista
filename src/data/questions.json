Instead of cleaning the string first, we process characters as we go.\n\nThe algorithm uses two pointers - one starting from the beginning of the string and the other from the end. We move these pointers toward each other, skipping any non-alphanumeric characters. For each valid pair of characters we encounter, we compare them after converting to lowercase.\n\nIf at any point the characters don't match, the string is not a palindrome. If the pointers meet or cross without finding any mismatches, the string is a palindrome.\n\nThis approach has O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the string, but uses O(1) extra space since we don't create a new string. This is more efficient than creating a cleaned string first, especially for long strings with many non-alphanumeric characters."
