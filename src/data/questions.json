      "explanation": "I approached this problem using the recursive divide-and-conquer strategy, which is ideal for constructing a height-balanced binary search tree from a sorted array.\n\nThe key insight is that to create a height-balanced BST, we should choose the middle element of the array as the root. This ensures that the left and right subtrees have approximately the same number of nodes.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Find the middle element of the array and make it the root\n2. Recursively build the left subtree using the elements to the left of the middle\n3. Recursively build the right subtree using the elements to the right of the middle\n\nInstead of repeatedly slicing the array, which would add extra time complexity, I used a helper function that tracks the current subarray bounds with indices. This makes the solution more efficient.\n\nTime complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array, as we need to process each element exactly once\nSpace complexity: O(log n) for the recursion stack in a balanced tree, as the maximum depth of recursion is log n"

      "explanation": "I implemented the optimized bottom-up recursive approach for this problem. This approach is more efficient than the naive top-down approach because it avoids recalculating heights of the same nodes multiple times.\n\nThe algorithm works by using a helper function `getHeight` that:\n1. Returns the height of a subtree if it's balanced\n2. Returns -1 if the subtree is not balanced\n\nAs we traverse the tree from bottom to top, we check three conditions at each node:\n1. If the left subtree is not balanced, the entire tree is not balanced\n2. If the right subtree is not balanced, the entire tree is not balanced\n3. If the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees exceeds 1, the tree is not balanced\n\nIf none of these conditions are met, we calculate the height of the current subtree and return it.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be O(n), but for a balanced tree, it would be O(log n)."
